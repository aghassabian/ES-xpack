```
The size of allocated memory to JVM is depend on your usage and system specification.

```yaml

- name: Run Elasticsearch
  docker_container:
    name: elasticsearch
    image: aghassabian/es-xpack
    state: started
    networks:
      - name: "{{ elastic_network }}"
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
      - "9300:9300"
    env:
        ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xms512m -Xmx1m"
